What is Implemented
========================

Overview
========================
The idea here is to document the knowns and unknowns with `pySym`. Generally
speaking, the basics of Python execution have mostly been implemented. By this
I mean, while loops, for loops, integers, arithmetic, bit operations, etc. I'll
focus mainly here on big picture structures.

Known Limitations
========================
* importing isn't implemented
* function scoping isn't implemented (meaning, if you declare a function inside another function, scope will be messed up)
* In some cases, call nesting with chaining doesn't work. Not sure exactly when this is, but for instance (test(test2()).rstrip("x")) i believe would fail.
* Case mixing is always a bit of a gamble (real/int/bitvec)

pyState functions
========================
* pyState.BVV(i,size=ast.Num(Z3_DEFAULT_BITVEC_SIZE))
    * Declares a BitVec Value of value "i" with optional BitVec size size
* pyState.BVS(size=ast.Num(Z3_DEFAULT_BITVEC_SIZE))
    * Declares a symbolic BitVec of max bits "size"
* pyState.Int()
    * Declares a symbolic Integer
* pyState.Real()
    * Declares a symbolic Real value
* pyState.String(length=ast.Num(Z3_MAX_STRING_LENGTH))
    * Declares a symbolic String value of length "length"

Example:

* If we want to declare a variable to be a Symbolic String of length 10, this would go in the python source code script that we're executing
    * s = pyState.String(10)
    * Note that you assign it like you would if you were executing it. Also, you do not need to from pySym import pyState to call this.
