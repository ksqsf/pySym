    ----------
    state : pyState.State
        pyState.State object to handle this element under

    -------
    list
        list contains state objects either generated or discovered through handling this ast.
    

    This function handles calls to Break. It is not meant to be called
    manually via a user. Under the hood, it simply pops off the call stack
    until a loop change is seen (i.e.: we've left the for loop)


    Example
    -------
    Example of ast.Break is: break

    while state.loop == None:
        state.popCallStack()

    # Good to go, pop out of our loop
